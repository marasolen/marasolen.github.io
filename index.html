        <h3>about</h3>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm a graduate student at The University of British Columbia in the Department of Computer Science. My supervisor is 
            <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/">Tamara Munzner</a> and my research interests are ininformation visualization. Additionally,
            I am the course facilitator for the Foundations of Software Development program at UBC Extended Learning and have been a TA for the courses 
            CPSC 110, CPSC 210, and CPSC 436V. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>interests</h3>
        <p>
            My main research interests are in data science, specifically information visualization, and how it intersects with education and
            engagement. Specifically, I hope to improve our understanding of and promote the use of situated visualization. This goal involves 
            researching how visualizations can be improved to be more personable and useful to individuals. All of this work has the end goal 
            of making visualizations more useful to general audiences.
        </p>
