        <h3>about</h3>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at The University of British Columbia in the Honours Computer Science specialization. In September
            I'll begin a graduate program at UBC. I am and will be working under Tamara Munzner to study information visualization. I'm also
            lead TA for Computer Science 110, the main introductory computer science course at UBC.
        </p>

        <h3>interests</h3>
        <p>
            My main research interests are in data science, specifically information visualization, and how it intersects with computer science 
            education. Specifically, I hope to make computer science education more effective, inclusive, and accessible by using information 
            visualization techniques to teach complex concepts in a clear and intuitive way and to, in general, provide information to students
            in ways that support them. This goal would involve researching how people understand visualizations: which ones are most effective 
            for which concepts, how they can be misleading, and how differences in educational background and socio-economic status can affect 
            how people understand visualizations. As part of this, I am also interested in exploring bias and ethics in visualization. All of 
            this work has the end goal of making educational environments and the world in general more inclusive and accessible.
        </p>
