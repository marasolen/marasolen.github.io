								<h2>Research</h2>
								I am interested in how visualization can be used to communicate with non-experts. In
								particular, I am interested in both formal and informal learning spaces: museums,
								nature, classrooms, media, etc. I work in the
								<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/group/infovis/">InfoVis lab at UBC</a>
								under the supervision of
	              <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/">Professor Tamara Munzner</a>.

					              A survey paper of visualiation literacy literature that identifies,

					              an analysis of participant pools from existing visualization literature
